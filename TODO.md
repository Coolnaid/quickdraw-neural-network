# to-do list
- [ ] fix the cat guessing problem (guesses cat all the time when in more than 3 classes)
- [ ] add relative paths for dir image (and possible dir cache) in 'quickdraw_dataset.py'
- [ ] check for hardcoded stuff like classes and model config and whatever else

# future
- [ ] maybe maybe turn it into a cnn and use better activation functions
